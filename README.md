sfthemes is a pair of [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org) themes, `theme_sf_light()`, `theme_sf_dark()`, and a collection of color scales based on [Apple's Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/). Themes are inspired by the occasional appearances of charts used by Apple within different contexts, e.g., Apple Health app, Screen Time on iOS and macOS. And colors are adapted from iOS, macOS, and watchOS system colors. Each color scale has a light and dark variant as well that compliments the light/dark themes, `scale_colour_ios_light()` and `scale_colour_ios_dark()`, respectively. In addition, sfthemes uses [dynamic type sizing](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/typography/) in order to provide a consistent and elegant overall resizing and re-scaling of plot elements. Read more [here](articles/typography.html).

When combined, sfthemes offers a unique opportunity to generate two version of your plot with two *similar* yet *individually* optimized color palettes for light and dark themes.
